Yes! Since you’re building a report to **analyze video engagement**, let’s step back and think like a product owner or learning platform analyst. Your current metrics are solid — but depending on your goal, we can improve _how we show them_ to give more insight.

- - -

## ✅ What You’re Currently Showing

| Metric | What It Tells You |
| --- | --- |
| `seconds_watched` | Total engagement time per video |
| `distinct_user_id` | Reach: how many unique users watched it |
| `avg_watch_time` | How long each viewer watched on average |

👍 These are useful! But let’s enhance it with **more context**.

## 🔄 Suggested Enhancements (Optional but Valuable)

- - -

### 1\. **Add a Completion Rate (% watched)**

Helps you know whether people finish videos.

sql

CopyEdit

`ROUND(AVG(seconds_watched * 1.0 / video_duration) * 100, 1) AS completion_rate`

You’d need to **add `video_duration`** either:

*   as a custom event param, or
    
*   by joining with a static reference table
    

- - -

### 2\. **Show Median Watch Time**

Average can be skewed by outliers. Median gives a more honest picture:

sql

CopyEdit

`APPROX_QUANTILES(seconds_watched, 2)[OFFSET(1)] AS median_watch_time`

- - -

### 3\. **Add Engagement Buckets (Watch Segments)**

Break down how many users watched:

*   Less than 30s
    
*   30–60s
    
*   Over 60s
    

This could be visualized in Looker as a bar or pie chart.

- - -

### 4\. **Trend Over Time (Time Series)**

Use `event_date` to show:

*   📈 Increase/decrease in watch time over time
    
*   📊 Engagement spikes by day/week
    

This gives great insight into when users are most active.

- - -

### 5\. **Add CTR or Drop-off After First Play (If You Track Plays Separately)**

If you're also tracking:

*   `video_play` events
    
*   `video_watch_time`
    

Then you could compute:

sql

CopyEdit

`watch_event_count / play_event_count AS engagement_followthrough_rate`

## 📊 Suggested Looker Studio Visuals

| Widget Type | Dimension | Metric(s) | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Table | `video_title` | `avg_watch_time`, `completion %` | Compare engagement per video |
| Time Series | `event_date` | `seconds_watched` | See watch trends over time |
| Bar Chart | `video_title` | `seconds_watched` | Rank by total watch time |
| Pie Chart | `watch_buckets` | `user_count` | Show audience distribution |

- - -

## ✅ Final Thoughts

If your goal is:

| Goal | Add This |
| --- | --- |
| Know how engaging videos are | Avg + median + completion rate |
| See trends | Use `event_date` time series |
| Spot best/worst videos | Rank by `avg_watch_time` + `reach` |
| Understand user behavior | Break down by watch segments |

Would you like me to rewrite your current BigQuery query to include:

*   `event_date`
    
*   `median_watch_time`
    
*   a placeholder for `video_duration` (in case you want to join it)?
    

Or do you want to build visual dashboards next based on your current data?
